Task Overview:
For my internship task, I had to design a simple Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL. The ALU needed to perform five operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Bitwise AND
Bitwise OR
Bitwise NOT

Design Process:
The ALU takes two inputs (A and B), and a control signal (OP) to select the operation.
The output (Y) is the result of the operation.
I also included optional flags for zero (if the result is 0) and carry (for overflow detection).

Testing:
I wrote a testbench to check if the ALU worked correctly with different inputs. I used ModelSim to:
Compile the Verilog code
Run simulations
View waveforms to check the outputs

Results:
The ALU worked as expected for all five operations.
I verified the outputs using waveform snapshots from the simulation.

Deliverables:
Verilog code for the ALU
Testbench for simulation
Simulation report with waveform results
#OUTPUT
ADDITION,SUBTRACTION
